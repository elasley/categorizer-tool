## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aces-pies-categorization.git
   cd aces-pies-categorization
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## 🔧 Configuration

### OpenAI Integration
- Get your API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
- Add to `.env` file as `REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Cost estimation: ~$0.15 per 1000 products using GPT-4o-mini

### Supported Brands
- 3M (body supplies, adhesives, abrasives)
- Loctite (threadlockers, sealants, adhesives)
- Fleetguard (filters, heavy-duty components)
- Gates (belts, hoses, timing components)
- Bendix (brake components, air brake systems)
- Mobil, Shell, Castrol (lubricants)
- And 15+ more...

## 📊 Performance

- **Small files** (<1K products): <10 seconds
- **Medium files** (1K-5K products): <60 seconds
- **Large files** (5K+ products): <3 minutes
- **Accuracy**: 85-95% depending on data quality
- **Memory efficient**: Handles up to 50K products

## 🎯 Usage

### Basic Workflow
1. **Upload CSV**: Drag and drop or select your automotive parts CSV file
2. **Auto-Categorize**: Click "AI-Enhance Categories" for automatic classification
3. **Review Results**: Check confidence scores and review flagged items
4. **Bulk Edit**: Use bulk reassignment tool for mass corrections
5. **Export**: Download results in your preferred format

### CSV Format Requirements
Your CSV should include columns for:
- Product Name (name, Name, product_name, Product Name)
- Description (description, Description, desc, details)
- Brand (brand, Brand, manufacturer, Manufacturer)
- Part Number (part_number, Part Number, sku, SKU)

### Example CSV:
```csv
Product Name,Description,Brand,Part Number
3M Sandpaper P320,Body work sanding disc for automotive refinishing,3M,31542
Gates Timing Belt,Heavy duty timing belt for commercial applications,Gates,T295
Bendix Brake Pads,Premium brake pads for heavy duty trucks,Bendix,D1210
```
